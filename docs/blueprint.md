# **App Name**: BatcompAI

## Core Features:

- Advanced Code Generation: AI-powered code generation that creates optimized code across multiple programming languages including Python, JavaScript, Solidity, and C++ using best practices.
- Context-Aware Suggestions: Uses external sources like official documentation and GitHub as a tool to give real-world context-aware coding suggestions and solutions.
- Voice Command & Narration: Provides spoken feedback using natural language, responding to user commands and questions. It can be enabled or disabled by the user
- Emotional Tone Adaptation: This is a tool that adjusts tone dynamically, responding with motivational or calming feedback based on detected emotional cues. Users will be informed before it begins monitoring voice for tone, and will be allowed to opt out.
- Dynamic Display: Displays code snippets and conversations with smooth auto-scrolling and interactive blocks with collapsible code sections.
- Mode Switching: Switches seamlessly between coding, chat, and debug modes using voice commands, with animated transitions to clearly denote the current context.
- API Integration: Handles third-party API integrations, utilizing provided API keys to fetch necessary real-time data.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Electric Indigo (#6F00FF) to capture the advanced, high-tech feel of a superhero's interface.
- Background color: Dark Indigo (#1A0033) to set a dark color scheme, that contrasts with the Electric Indigo primary.
- Accent color: Violet (#8F00FF) to create a distinct, analogous color, different in brightness and saturation from the Electric Indigo primary.
- Holographic-style elements overlaid on dynamic panels for a futuristic UI, optimized for both readability and interaction.
- Font: 'Space Grotesk', a sans-serif, is used for both headers and body text, creating a consistent tech-focused feel.
- Fluid transitions and animations, including smooth auto-scrolling text and interactive, collapsible code blocks to guide user attention.
